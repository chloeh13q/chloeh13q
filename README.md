### Hi there 👋

- 🌲 I'm currently doing my Master's in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford while doing research in digital health with a focus in autism (specifically using ML and AI to analyze behaviors expressed by children while interacting with family members via home video).
- 📖 I started learning more about open source recently and am always looking for cool projects to contribute to.
- 🛫 Because of the pandemic, my college graduation trip never happened. Instead, I spent the summer learning new things. My next travel destination is Iceland (hopefully)!
- 🐶 I became a full-time dog mom this year!
- 📪 I'm always looking for new passions and adventures; drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-he/) or via email if you want to chat more!
